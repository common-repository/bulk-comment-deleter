== Description ==

Bulk Comment Deleter is a free WordPress plugin to delete SPAM, Unapproved or ALL comments from the database.

The easiest way to delete all **SPAM** comments, **Pending** comments or **ALL** WordPress comments at once.

Upon activation, three new buttons will be added to the Comments screen:

- Delete All Unapproved - This option will let you delete all Unapproved comments.
- Bulk Delete SPAM - This option will let you batch delete every SPAM comment.
- Delete ALL - This option will let you delete ALL comments on your WordPress website.

Simply click on a button and confirm the delete process.

After revisiting the comments page, you will see all comments safely deleted from your WordPress site.

> **Note**: This action is irreversible and you need to make a complete WordPress backup before moving forward. This will allow you to restore comments if you change your mind.

The plugin will NOT delete comments from trash.
